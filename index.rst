**ArcheOS** is the acronym of Archeological Operating System. It is a **GNU/Linux** live distribution built for archaeological aims. 
At the moment a new version (5.0 codename "**Theodoric**") based on Debian “Wheezy” is under development.
To run ArcheOS, you have to burn a DVD with the .iso image and put it inside your DVD reader. Then restart the computer. 
It is also possible to install ArcheOS on your harddisk (click on the install ArcheOS icon).
ArcheOS is developed following the **OpArc project** guidelines and it is released by `Arc-Team s.n.c`_. under the General Public License (GPL).
